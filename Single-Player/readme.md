# My Conways Game Of Life


[Conways Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns) Cellular Automation game for CS30 Unit1. 

## Plans 

Will deploy the app using [repl](https://repl.it/languages/pygame), since pygame is not the best for web game deployement. 

I have a vaque idea on how I could deploy using Flask, but I will save that if I finish my MVP early.
