    "\n",
    "For our Computer Science Unit 1 build week at [Lambda](https://lambdaschool.com/), all of us had the option to create our own version of [Conways Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).\n",
    "I decided to do that and created my own using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news). \n",

    "            You can find relevant links to check it out for yourself here:\n",

    "\n",
    "But, as a Data Science student, we also had to the option to create, from scratch, any of the acceptable Data Science specific algorithms, which can be found in this [repo readme](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Data-Science-Build-Week-1). \n",
    "\n",
    "As I worked on the game itself, I thought of an idea, why not create a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch, train the game on it and compare it with the keras cnn model. Thats what this notebook is for. \n",
